This is the first project made by me, Mateo C.
This project's core is to explore how [GitHub](https://github.com/katzematt10) works and learn how to use properly the main tools that the website offers to its users.

Be free to comment, any suggestion will be considered. Additionally, visit my [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/feed/my_videos) where I have some videos about discrete simulation and Excel macros.

Created by the amazing MateoC
Including examples of simulation and Excel creation macros on Youtube
